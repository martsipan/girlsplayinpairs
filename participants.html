              <strong>Anna Knutas Blomquist</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
              Anna Knutas Blomquist is a fashion designer born in 1965. She studied fashion design at ESMOD in Paris and then stayed in France for 15 years where she got a wide experience in design, trend consulting, illustration and teaching, mostly in Paris but also in the south of France.
          </p>
          <p>
              Her first job at a couture fashion house where she got to experience the fantastic work in the ”ateliers” has shaped her vision of fashion as an art form, but it also made her long to design clothes for ”ordinary people” who can not afford to buy custom-made garments.
          </p>
          <p>
              After her 2 children were born, the family moved from Provence to Stockholm where Anna continued to work as a designer for several brands. Through her work and through her many inspiration- and production trips around the world, she has come to question the commercial aspect of fast fashion, stereotypes, working conditions and consumption. To experience other cultures, to see the back side of fashion, where it is actually manufactured, the knowledge and everything you do not normally see or notíce has of course been very enriching too. 
          </p>
          <p>
              She was one of the co-founders of the brand K-OURAGE, whose idea was that fashion must dare to take a stand and to take responsibility. To unite courage and fashion (mod och mode) Anna left K-OURAGE 2018 and is currently working for the French / Swedish brand Busnel, whose 100-year-old small factory in Bretagne stands for the craftsmanship and quality she values. At the same time, she has a residence at Transit kulturinkubator in Stockholm, where she explores clothes and fashion from a more artistic perspective in terms of volume and shape, gender, reusing the already worn and what is considered beautiful and ugly. She lovingly dissects old garments, remodels them. And turns them, preconceptions and herself inside out.
