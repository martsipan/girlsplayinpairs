              Marta:  Yesterday, I visited the <a href="http://www.ffbiz.de/index.html" target="_blank">FFBIZ </a> feminist archive in Berlin. I was warmly welcomed and guided through the material and artifacts of the their fantastic collection!
          </p>
          <p>
              Some of the highlights was the tomato throwing incident in Frankfurt in 1968, which became some sort of official starting point of the second wave feminist movement in Germany. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrid_Damm-R%C3%BCger" target="_blank">Sigrid Rüger</a>, heavily pregnant at the time, attended a conference of the Socialist German Student Union, and deeply disappointed by the lack of consideration given to women's issues in the discussions and activities of the union, she threw several tomatoes in the direction of the row of male SDS participants, uttering an exclamation as she did it.

          <p>
              From there on I got introduced to the work and activities of hundred of women's movement groups and organisations in Germany - I was moved to tears by the volume of documents, diaries, protocols, posters, letters that these decades of activism had left behind. All their work and struggles, and the enormous impact this have made on the society I’m living in today. It was almost as if the boxes of documents standing on these high shelves were radiating from the energy, drive and experience that they contain. Making the air thick, filling it with a huge choir of voices.
          </p>
          <p>
              I was especially intrigued by the letter correspondence and relationship between <a href="http://www.a3mreunion.org/remembrance/troeger-a.html" target="_blank">Annemarie Tröger </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilde_Radusch" target="_blank">Hilde Radusch</a>. They were both feminist activists, Annemarie during the second feminist wave in the 1970’s and Hilde in the 1920’s. After the war, the women stayed in touch and wrote letters to each other. Annemarie wanted to publish a book about Hilde, but the material was never released. Two women, each on one side of the war that completely put an end to the growing feminist activities during the 20’s in Europe.
          </p>
          <p>
              Their relationship, which both tries to reconnect to the history of feminism and at the same time looking forwards and building upon the existing movement, is touching upon the affidamento relationship and transgenerational approach of our project. Very inspiring and hopeful!
